Here are some possible test cases:

```python
import unittest
from file2 import parse_content, PolicySearch  # assume this is how you import these in your actual test
from django.urls import reverse  # assuming you want to use Django's URL reversing
import pandas as pd
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class TestParseContent(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.content = """INFORMATION: some info1 SOURCE: http://www.test.com/information1 INFORMATION: some info2 SOURCE: https://www.test.com/information2"""

    def test_parse_content(self):
        entries = parse_content(self.content)
        self.assertEqual(len(entries), 2)

class TestPolicySearch(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.policy_search = PolicySearch()

    def test_policy_search_filter_by_account(self):
        # assuming you have some dummy objects created
        pass

    def test_policy_search_order_by_created_at(self):
        # same comment as above, these would actually be quite complex tests
        pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
